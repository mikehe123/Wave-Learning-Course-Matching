In the first half of the course, we will cover basic statistics, including numerical and graphical summaries of data, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and distributions. The latter half will teach machine learning models, including regression, clustering, decision trees, and neural networks. We will incorporate current applications as the course progresses to motivate these techniques. Each class focuses on applications to a particular field(s) of study and is taught jointly by two instructors, one specializing in statistics and the other in machine learning.

Would you like to construct a foundation within the subject while also studying real-world examples of its practical application? Well, you’ve come to the right place. This class will take you on a journey mapping out the rudimentary aspects of a political system ranging from the basic structures of a government to the diversity of political ideology. We will look at countries like China, the U.K., the U.S., and others that manifest some basic commonalities of governments around the world in conjunction with their own unique aspects. We will also attempt to explore the history and impacts of policies surrounding contemporary issues around elections, education, healthcare, and foreign policy. Each day of instruction will be divided by topical relevance to the basic functions of a government, domestic policy, foreign policy, elections/campaigns, and political ideology. Activities, such as extended discussions guided by thematic questions, will be conducted regularly during the class to create an atmosphere of interactivity and comfortability. In this class, you will also be responsible for creating and presenting a final project on a relevant political issue and proposing a solution to said issue. To give you time in doing so, the last 15-30 minutes of each class day will be allocated for independent work and research on an approved topic.

I will assign 8-9 current or evolving earth problems to the participants divided into groups. I will ask them to come up with some wild but implementable ideas to solve these problems. We all know that creativity is a life long lesson. It can not be achieved within just five classes. But I believe after taking part in this seminar, every learner will understand the importance of creativity and innovation in our life. They will get a chance to practice these skills individually and within a group in different phases of the seminar. I am really excited to meet with the learners or future global citizens who will solve critical problems with their sharp knowledge and creative minds. See you at the seminar.","courseTitle":"Creativity and innovation: How to think like a genius","edLink":"https://us.edstem.org/courses/2924/discussion/","maxClassSize":100,"picture":"https://wavelearningfestival09b1e9c1379946ca9080bb9c526164155-dev.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Creativity+and+innovation+How+to+think+like+a+genius.jpg","prereqs":"Aspiration and willpower to learn anything, do many things and achieve everything in life","syllabus":null,"targetAudience":[8,12,11,10,9],"teachers":["teacher17"],"zoomLink":"https://harvard.zoom.us/j/94724048273?pwd=VGpJY2toVXNDRDlpVGZlN3J5K1RIdz09","hostCode":"372259","idealClassSize":60,"restrict":false,"tide":2,"dates":null,"wave":null,"createdAt":"2020-09-23T15:16:16.885Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-14T19:52:24.061Z","tableData":{"id":88}},{"id":"seminar56","classTimes":"3:00 - 4:30pm","classDays":"[\"Saturday\", \"Tuesday\"]","classDates":"Nov 17 - Dec 12","courseCategory":["business","culture","lifestyle"],"courseDescription":"As compared to the actual world, we live comparatively guarded lives within the confines of our educational institutions.

These questions -- and many, many more -- occupy the minds of researchers and students of Physics all around the globe every single day.  In this course, we will endeavor to equip you with the theoretical tools to start investigating such questions on your own.  Across nine class sessions, we will offer a cursory introduction to the major subjects that every undergraduate Physics student encounters: Mechanics, Electricity & Magnetism, Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, & Thermodynamics.  Though each subject requires at least a lifetime of mathematical study to truly “master” (if mastery can be spoken of in research science…), a conceptual introduction with a little bit of (hopefully) familiar mathematics will not only prepare students for the possibility of further study, but will also teach students how physicists organize and think through a physical problem.  Even if you have no intention to pursue Physics in college and beyond, the physicist’s practice of questioning and problem solving is an invaluable skill to carry into any profession or field of study.  Plus, you may just pick up a few fun party facts along the way.","courseTitle":"Physics 101: A Guide to Physical Phenomena","edLink":"https://edstem.org/us/courses/6705/discussion/","maxClassSize":50,"picture":"https://wavelearningfestival09b1e9c1379946ca9080bb9c526164155-dev.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public/physics.jpeg","prereqs":"None","syllabus":null,"targetAudience":[9,10,11,12],"teachers":["teacher177","teacher178"],"zoomLink":"https://zoom.us/j/95301624491?pwd=SUQrOSszMUUyRjJLaTNwK01sc25Ddz09","hostCode":"439179","idealClassSize":25,"restrict":false,"tide":null,"dates":null,"wave":2,"createdAt":"2021-06-14T03:35:48.774Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-16T05:55:49.093Z","tableData":{"id":125}},{"id":"seminar39","classTimes":"7:00 - 9:00pm","classDays":"[Monday]","classDates":"October 5 - November 2","courseCategory":[""],"courseDescription":"The Gordian Knot, an ancient puzzle that marked a legendary chapter of Alexander the Great, has become the term used to describe complex and unsolvable problems.

But we do know very specific things about them—their patrilineal society, their focus on animal husbandry, their lack of understanding of silver smelting. How? Their words. No one speaks their language today, but we do have reconstructions of their words based on languages that descended from Proto-Indo-European—languages as diverse as Bengali, Armenian, and English. Archaeology’s not just digging in the dirt. Come explore how old words can be put together to make discoveries, and how regular sound changes can tell us what words people were using thousands of years ago. We will reconstruct ancient words and show how they can be adapted to fit other languages. You'll learn how different languages have different sets of sounds, and how we can use these sounds to plumb the depths of the past. We'll talk about the history of individual words and languages, as well as general patterns of change.","courseTitle":"Linguistic Archaeology","edLink":"","maxClassSize":15,"picture":null,"prereqs":"None","syllabus":null,"targetAudience":[12,11,9,8,7,6,10],"teachers":["ebef6230-566e-4529-ba55-ca4781d61302"],"zoomLink":"https://harvard.zoom.us/j/91283303370?pwd=UXlad2xKWkZ1SmxMVExQTExWb3hyZz09","hostCode":"072231","idealClassSize":15,"restrict":false,"tide":1,"dates":null,"wave":null,"createdAt":"2020-09-23T15:16:16.885Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-23T15:16:16.885Z","tableData":{"id":163}},{"id":"seminar34","classTimes":"12:00 - 1:00pm","classDays":"[Saturday]","classDates":"October 10 - October 31","courseCategory":[""],"courseDescription":"Does .999...=1? Can a sphere be reassembled into two identically sized spheres? Is the consistency of mathematical systems unprovable? Surprisingly, the answer to all of these questions is yes! And at the heart of each question, there lies paradox. For millennia, paradoxes have shaped mathematics and guided mathematical progress. From the ancient paradoxes of Zeno to the modern paradoxes of Russel, paradoxes remind us of the constant need to revamp our mathematical understanding. It is for this reason that paradoxes are so important. Paradoxes: Guiding Forces in Mathematical Exploration ​provides a survey of mathematical paradoxes spanning a wide variety of topics; delving into each paradox mathematically, philosophically, and historically. Students will gain a full picture of how paradoxes have contributed to and guided the progress of mathematics in many ways. This course also provides the student with a robust argument for the inclusion of paradoxes in education. This is all presented in a way that is accessible to anyone with a high school background in mathematics! Entertaining and educational, this course will appeal to any student looking for a mathematical and philosophical challenge.","courseTitle":"Paradoxes: Guiding Forces in Mathematical Exploration","edLink":"","maxClassSize":100,"picture":null,"prereqs":"None","syllabus":null,"targetAudience":[12,11,9,8,7,6,10],"teachers":["c8eff0b7-5dbf-478d-a5a4-f3c78faa6417"],"zoomLink":"https://harvard.zoom.us/j/95315184230?pwd=K1dPTG9LUFNJaE9FN3NTQStpYWdTUT09","hostCode":"372259","idealClassSize":100,"restrict":false,"tide":1,"dates":null,"wave":null,"createdAt":"2020-09-23T15:16:16.885Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-23T15:16:16.885Z","tableData":{"id":164}},{"id":"seminar109","classTimes":"7:00 - 8:30pm","classDays":"","classDates":"March 17 - April 7","courseCategory":["arts, socialScience, culture"],"courseDescription":"Want to create real social change through theatre and performing arts right in your own community?
