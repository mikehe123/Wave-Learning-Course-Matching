Would you like to construct a foundation within the subject while also studying real-world examples of its practical application? Well, you’ve come to the right place. This class will take you on a journey mapping out the rudimentary aspects of a political system ranging from the basic structures of a government to the diversity of political ideology. We will look at countries like China, the U.K., the U.S., and others that manifest some basic commonalities of governments around the world in conjunction with their own unique aspects. We will also attempt to explore the history and impacts of policies surrounding contemporary issues around elections, education, healthcare, and foreign policy. Each day of instruction will be divided by topical relevance to the basic functions of a government, domestic policy, foreign policy, elections/campaigns, and political ideology. Activities, such as extended discussions guided by thematic questions, will be conducted regularly during the class to create an atmosphere of interactivity and comfortability. In this class, you will also be responsible for creating and presenting a final project on a relevant political issue and proposing a solution to said issue. To give you time in doing so, the last 15-30 minutes of each class day will be allocated for independent work and research on an approved topic. The main goal behind this project and the aforementioned class discussions would be to inspire you to pursue a career in debate, political science, or an associated field that tests your creativity and critical thinking skills. You will be tested on whether you can create both creative and pragmatic solutions to issues our modern world is facing today in the realm of politics. Lastly, this class will also lead you to attaining a broader understanding of the ideologies that drive political discourse today and where they come from within our socioeconomic environments.","courseTitle":"Political Theory and its Application in Contemporary Society","edLink":"https://us.edstem.org/courses/2930/discussion/","maxClassSize":30,"picture":"https://wavelearningfestival09b1e9c1379946ca9080bb9c526164155-dev.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Political+Theory+and+its+Application+in+Contemporary+Society.jpg","prereqs":"None","syllabus":null,"targetAudience":[8,11,10,9],"teachers":["9a923688-3639-47e9-8347-ec513d463ad2"],"zoomLink":"https://harvard.zoom.us/j/97002415869?pwd=MWdVTkdmR0JJMnVhUnQ2VTAwblBKUT09","hostCode":"372259","idealClassSize":25,"restrict":false,"tide":2,"dates":null,"wave":null,"createdAt":"2020-09-23T15:16:16.885Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-14T19:53:55.853Z","tableData":{"id":43}},{"id":"seminar43","classTimes":"5:00 - 7:00pm","classDays":"[Wednesday]","classDates":"October 7 - November 4","courseCategory":[""],"courseDescription":"The Generation of Change is a two-week workshop which aims to prepare participants from a variety of backgrounds for effective advocacy work.

The participants will test their creative skills through online and offline assessments. They will also be able to create their own Personal Creativity Machine (PCM). The more they use this, the better creative and innovative ideas will be discovered by them. In this seminar, the audiences will understand how our traditional academic systems are gradually killing our creativity skills when we grow up. They will also find possible ways to get rid of this conventional chain of rules. They will also learn about the very effective Zi-Zo-Zi method for discovering and delivering ideas. Participants will also learn about the story behind some common objects which we use in our daily life. At the ending part of the seminar, a group activity will occur. I will assign 8-9 current or evolving earth problems to the participants divided into groups. I will ask them to come up with some wild but implementable ideas to solve these problems. We all know that creativity is a life long lesson. It can not be achieved within just five classes. But I believe after taking part in this seminar, every learner will understand the importance of creativity and innovation in our life. They will get a chance to practice these skills individually and within a group in different phases of the seminar.

By focusing on Statistics and Statistical Programming, we hope to give the students an idea of both what statistics is and where every statistics project starts. We will investigate the most famous Paradoxes and Riddles in Probability and show the students that Statistics is interesting & fun. Nowadays, with the increasing amount of data available, Statistics allows us to understand every topic much more deeply.

Would you like to construct a foundation within the subject while also studying real-world examples of its practical application? Well, you’ve come to the right place. This class will take you on a journey mapping out the rudimentary aspects of a political system ranging from the basic structures of a government to the diversity of political ideology. We will look at countries like China, the U.K., the U.S., and others that manifest some basic commonalities of governments around the world in conjunction with their own unique aspects. We will also attempt to explore the history and impacts of policies surrounding contemporary issues around elections, education, healthcare, and foreign policy. Each day of instruction will be divided by topical relevance to the basic functions of a government, domestic policy, foreign policy, elections/campaigns, and political ideology. Activities, such as extended discussions guided by thematic questions, will be conducted regularly during the class to create an atmosphere of interactivity and comfortability. In this class, you will also be responsible for creating and presenting a final project on a relevant political issue and proposing a solution to said issue. To give you time in doing so, the last 15-30 minutes of each class day will be allocated for independent work and research on an approved topic. The main goal behind this project and the aforementioned class discussions would be to inspire you to pursue a career in debate, political science, or an associated field that tests your creativity and critical thinking skills. You will be tested on whether you can create both creative and pragmatic solutions to issues our modern world is facing today in the realm of politics. Lastly, this class will also lead you to attaining a broader understanding of the ideologies that drive political discourse today and where they come from within our socioeconomic environments.","courseTitle":"Political Theory and its Application in Contemporary Society","edLink":"","maxClassSize":30,"picture":null,"prereqs":"None","syllabus":null,"targetAudience":[12,11,9,8,7,6,10],"teachers":[""],"zoomLink":"https://harvard.zoom.us/j/92003315597?pwd=UGd2Z0tlY0JHd2E3MFl5TTdqOHF5dz09","hostCode":"072231","idealClassSize":30,"restrict":false,"tide":1,"dates":null,"wave":null,"createdAt":"2020-09-23T15:16:16.885Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-23T15:16:16.885Z","tableData":{"id":98}},{"id":"seminar138","classTimes":"6:00 - 7:30pm","classDays":"TThu, Frii","classDates":"June 10 - June 25","courseCategory":["politics"],"courseDescription":"Do you have an interest in politics?
